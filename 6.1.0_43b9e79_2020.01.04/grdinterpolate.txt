gmt grdinterpolate [core] 6.1.0_43b9e79_2020.01.04 [64-bit] - Interpolate new layers from a 3-D netCDF data cube

usage: gmt grdinterpolate <3Dgrid> | <grd1> <grd2> ... -G<outgrid> -T[<min>/<max>/]<inc>[<unit>][+n]
	[-Fl|a|c|n][+1|2] [-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r]] [-V[<level>]] [-Zi<levels>|o] [--PAR=<value>]

	<3Dgrid> is the name of the input 3D netCDF data cube.
	   However, with -Zi we instead expect a series of 2-D grids.
	-G Specify output grid file name (or template; see -Zo).
	-T Interpolate the 3-D grid at given levels across the 3rd dimension
	   Make evenly spaced output time steps from <min> to <max> by <inc>.
	   Append +n to indicate <inc> is the number of knot-values to produce over the range instead.
	   Alternatively, give a file with output knots in the first column, or a comma-separated list.

	OPTIONS:
	-F Set the grid interpolation mode.  Choose from:
	   l Linear interpolation.
	   a Akima spline interpolation.
	   c Cubic spline interpolation.
	   n No interpolation (nearest point).
	   Optionally, append +1 for 1st derivative or +2 for 2nd derivative.
	   [Default is -Fa].
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
	-Z Read or write 2-D grids that make up a virtual 3-D data cube.
	   To read a series of input 2-D grids, give -Zi<levels>, where <levels>
	   for each grid is set via min/max/inc, <zfile>, or a comma-separated list.
	   To write a series of output 2-D grids, give -Zo and use a floating-point
	   C-format statement as part of the filename set via -G for unique file names.
