	<cruises> can be one of five kinds of specifiers:
	1) 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g., 01010083, JA010010, etc., etc.
	2) 2-character <agency> codes which will return all cruises from each agency.
	3) 4-character <agency><vessel> codes, which will return all cruises from those vessels.
	4) A single =<list>, where <list> is a table with NGDC IDs, one per line.
	5) If nothing is specified we return all cruises in the data base.
	   [See the documentation for agency and vessel codes].
	-F <dataflags> is a comma-separated string made up of one or more of these abbreviations

	     weight:  Report weight as specified in -W [1].
	  The data are written in the order specified in <dataflags>.
	  Shortcut flags are:
	     mgd77:   The full set of all 27 fields in the MGD77 specification.
	     mgd77t:  The full set of all 26 columns in the MGD77T specification.
	     geo:     time,lon,lat + the 7 geophysical observations.
	     all:     As mgd77 but with time items written as a date-time string.
	     allt:    As mgd77t but with time items written as a date-time string.
	     dat:     As mgd77t but in plain table file order.
	    Append + to include the 5 derived quantities dist, azim, cc, vel, and weight [see -W]
	    [Default is all].
	  Abbreviations in UPPER CASE will suppress records where any such column is NaN.
	  (Note that -E is a shorthand to set all abbreviations to upper case).
	  Optionally, append comma-separated logical tests that data columns must pass to be output.
	  (Note: These checks do not applied to derived or computed data columns).
	  Format is <flag><OP><value>, where flag is any of the dataflags above, and <OP> is
	  one of the operators <, <=, =, >=, >, |, and !=.  <value> is the limit you are testing,
	  including NaN (with = and != only).  If <flag> is UPPERCASE the test MUST be passed;
	  else at least ONE of the tests must pass for output to take place.  When using operators
	  involving characters <, >, and |, put entire argument to -F in single quotes.
	  Finally, for MGD77+ files you may optionally append : followed by one or more comma-
	  separated -+|-<col> terms.  This compares specific E77 bitflags for each listed column
	  + means bit must be 1, - means it must be 0.  All bit tests given must be passed.
	  By default, MGD77+ files with error bit flags will use the flags to suppress bad data.
	  Turn this behavior off by append : with no arguments.  For controlling systematic
	  corrections encoded in MGD77+ files, see -T.
