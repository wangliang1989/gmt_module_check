	-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r] [-A[m|p|x|y]] [-N[z|Z|p|P][<values>]] [-S<radius>[<unit>] | <xlim>/<ylim>]
	[-V[<level>]] [-a<col>=<name>[,...]] [-bi[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-di<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>]
	[-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]] [-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]]

	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-G Specify file name for output mask grid file.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).

	OPTIONS:
	-A Suppress connecting geographic points using great circle arcs, i.e., connect by straight lines,
	   unless m or p is appended to first follow meridian then parallel, or vice versa.
	   For Cartesian data, use -Ax or -Ay to connect first in x, then y, or vice versa.
	   Ignored if -S is used since input data are then considered to be points.
	-N Set <out>/<edge>/<in> to use if node is outside, on the path, or inside.
	   NaN is a valid entry.  Default values are 0/0/1.
	   Alternatively, use -Nz (inside) or -NZ (inside & edge) to set the inside
	   nodes of a polygon to a z-value obtained as follows (in this order):
	     a) If OGR/GMT files, get z-value via -aZ=<name> for attribute <name>.
	     b) Interpret segment z-values (-Z<zval>) as the z-value.
	     c) Interpret segment labels (-L<label>) as the z-value.
	   Finally, use -Np|P and append origin for running polygon IDs [0].
	   For -Nz|Z|p|P you may optionally append /<out [0].
	-S Set search radius to identify inside points.
	   Append e (meter), f (foot), k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile), u (survey foot)
	   d (arc degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc second) [e].
	   Spherical distances are based on great-circle calculations;
	   see -j<mode> for other modes of measurements.
	   Mask nodes are set to <in> or <out> depending on whether they are
	   inside the circle of specified radius [0] from the nearest data point.
	   Give radius as 'z' if individual radii are provided via the 3rd data column
	   and append a fixed unit unless Cartesian.
	   For Cartesian grids with different x and y units you may append <xlim>/<ylim>;
	   this sets all nodes within the rectangular area of the given half-widths to inside.
	   One can also achieve the rectangular selection effect by using the -S<n_cells>c
	   form. Here n_cells means the number of cells around each data point. As an example,
	   -S0c means that only the cell where point lies is masked, -S1c masks one cell
	   beyond that (i.e. makes a 3x3 neighborhood), and so on.
	   [Default is to assume <table> contains polygons and use inside/outside searching].
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-a Give one or more comma-separated <col>=<name> associations
	   [Default selects all aspatial fields].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [2].
	-di Replace any <nodata> in input data with NaN.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i|o][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input or o for output only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output since none will be read.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Set alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-j Set spherical distance calculation mode for modules that offer that flexibility.
	   Append f for Flat Earth, g for Great Circle [Default], and e for Ellipsoidal mode.
	-n+b<BC> Set boundary conditions.  <BC> can be either:
	   g for geographic, p for periodic, and n for natural boundary conditions.
	   For p and n you may optionally append x or y [default is both]:
	     x applies the boundary condition for x only
	     y applies the boundary condition for y only
	   [Default: Natural conditions, unless grid is geographic].
	-qi Select input rows to process [Default reads all rows].
	   Append comma-separated lists of rows or row ranges; prepend ~ to exclude those ranges instead.
	   Append +f or +s to reset row counters per table or segment [per set (+a)].
	   For limits on data values instead, append +c<col> and give data limits for input column <col>.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
