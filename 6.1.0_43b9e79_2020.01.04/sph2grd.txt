gmt sph2grd [core] 6.1.0_43b9e79_2020.01.04 [64-bit] - Compute grid from spherical harmonic coefficients

usage: gmt sph2grd [coeff_file] -G<grdfile> -I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]]
	-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r] [-Dg|n] [-E] [-F[k]<filter>] [-N<norm>] [-Q]
	[-V[<level>]] [-bi[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]]
	[-e[~]<pattern>] [-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]]
	[-r[g|p]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]]  [--PAR=<value>]

	-G filename for output grid file.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	The input is expected to contain records of degree, order, cos, sin.
	-D Will evaluate a derived field from a geopotential model.  Choose between
	   -Dg will compute the gravitational field [Add -E for anomalies on ellipsoid]
	   -Dn will compute the geoid [Add -E for anomalies on ellipsoid]
	-E to evaluate expansion on the current ellipsoid [Default is sphere]
	-F Filter coefficients according to one of two kinds of filter specifications:.
	   Use -Fk if values are given in km [Default is coefficient degree L]
	   a) Cosine band-pass: Append four wavelengths <lc>/<lp>/<hp>/<hc>.
	      coefficients outside <lc>/<hc> are cut; inside <lp>/<hp> are passed, rest are tapered.
	      Replace wavelength by - to skip, e.g., -F-/-/50/75 is a low-pass filter.
	   b) Gaussian band-pass: Append two wavelengths <lo>/<hi> where filter amplitudes = 0.5.
	      Replace wavelength by - to skip, e.g., -F70/- is a high-pass Gaussian filter.
	-N Normalization used for coefficients.  Choose among
	   m: Mathematical normalization - inner products summed over surface equal 1 [Default]
	   g: Geodesy normalization - inner products summed over surface equal 4pi
	   s: Schmidt normalization - as used in geomagnetism
	-Q Coefficients have phase convention from physics, i.e., the (-1)^m factor
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [4].
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-h[i|o][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input or o for output only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output since none will be read.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Set alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
