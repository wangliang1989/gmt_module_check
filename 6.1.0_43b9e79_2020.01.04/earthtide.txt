gmt earthtide [geodesy] 6.1.0_43b9e79_2020.01.04 [64-bit] - Compute grids or time-series of solid Earth tides

usage: gmt earthtide [-G<outgrid>] [-C<comp>] [-L<lon>/<lat>]
	[-I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]]] [-T[<min>/<max>/][-|+]<inc>[<unit>][+n]]
	[-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r]] [-S]
	[-bo[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [-r[g|p]] [ ] [--PAR=<value>]

	-G Specify file name for output grid file(s).
	   If more than one component is set via -C then <outgrid> must contain %s to format component code.

	OPTIONS:
	-C List of comma-separated components to be written as grids (requires -G). Choose from
	   x|e, y|n, z|v. [Default is v(ertical) only].
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-L <lon/lat> Geographical coordinate where to compute the time-series.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).
	-S Output position of Sun and Moon in geographical coordinates plus
	   distance in meters. Output is a Mx7 matrix, where M is the number of
	   times (set by -T) and columns are time, sun_lon, sun_lat, sun_dist
	   moon_lon, moon_lat, moon_dist.
	-T Make evenly spaced output time steps from <min> to <max> by <inc>.
	   Append +n to indicate <inc> is the number of t-values to produce over the range instead.
	   Append a valid time unit (y|o|w|d|h|m|s) to the increment and add +t.
	   If no -T is provided get current time in UTC from the computer clock.
	   If no -G or -S are provided then -T is interpreted to mean compute a time-series
	   at the location specified by -L, thus then -L becomes mandatory.
	   When -G and -T only first time T series is considered.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
