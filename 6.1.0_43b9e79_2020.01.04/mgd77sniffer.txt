usage: gmt mgd77sniffer <cruises> [-A<fieldabbrev>,<scale>,<offset>] [-Cmaxspd] [-Dd|e|E|f|l|m|s|v][r]
	[-E] [-F] [-G<fieldabbrev>,<imggrid>,<scale>,<mode>[,<latmax>] or -G<fieldabbrev>,<grid>] [-H]
	[-I<fieldabbrev>,<rec1>,<recN>] [-L<custom_limits_file>] [-M] [-N]

	[-V[<level>]] [-Z<level>] [-bo[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-do<nodata>] [-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>]] [--PAR=<value>]

	Scan MGD77 files for errors using point-by-point sanity checking,
		along-track detection of excessive slopes and comparison of cruise
		data with global bathymetry and gravity grids.	where <cruises> is one or more MGD77 legnames, e.g., 08010001 etc.

	OPTIONS:
	-A Apply scale factor and DC adjustment to specified data field. Allows adjustment of
	   cruise data prior to along-track analysis. CAUTION: data must be thoroughly examined
	   before applying these global data adjustments. May not be used for multiple cruises.
	-C Set maximum ship speed (10 m/s by default, use -N to indicate knots).
	-D Dump cruise data such as sniffer limits, values, gradients and mgd77 records.
	  -Dd print out cruise-grid differences (requires -G option).
	  -De output formatted error summary for each record. See E77 ERROR FORMAT below.
	  -DE same as -De but no regression checks will be done.
	  -Df for each field, output value change and distance (or time with -St) since last observation.
	  -Dl print out mgd77sniffer default limits (requires no additional arguments).
	  -Dm print out MGD77 format
	  -Ds print out gradients
	  -Dv print out values.
	  -Dn print out distance to coast for each record (requires -Gnav).
	   Append r to include all records (default omits records where navigation errors were detected).
	-E Reverse navigation quality flags (good to bad and vice versa). May be necessary when a
	   majority of navigation fixes are erroneously flagged bad, which can happen when a cruise's
	   first navigation fix is extremely erroneous. Caution! This will affect sniffer output and
	   should only be attempted after careful manual navigation review.
	-G Compare cruise data to the specified GMT geographic grid or Sandwell/Smith Mercator img grid
	   a) Compare cruise data to the specified Sandwell/Smith Mercator grid. Requires valid MGD77
	   field abbreviation followed by a comma, the path (if not in current directory)
	   and grid filename, scale (0.1 or 1), and mode (see mgd77manage for details).
	   Optionally, append max latitude in the IMG file [72.0059773539]. Nav on land
	   test can be activated using the -G option and requires a distance to nearest
	   coast grid (i.e., -Gnav,/data/GRIDS/dist_to_land.grd) with distance reported in cm.
	   b) Compare cruise data to the specified GMT geographic grid. Requires valid MGD77 field abbreviation
	   followed by a comma, then the path (if not in current directory) and grid filename.
	   Excessive offsets are flagged according to maxArea threshold (use -L option to
	   adjust maxArea). Useful for comparing faa or depth to global grids though any MGD77
	   field can be compared to any GMT or IMG compatible grid. Multiple grid comparison is
	   supported by  using separate -G calls for each grid.  See GRID FILE INFO below.
	   Nav on land test can be activated using the -G option and requires a distance to
	   nearest coast grid (i.e., -Gnav,/data/GRIDS/dist_to_land.grd) with distance reported
	   in cm.
	-H (with -G only) disable (or force) decimation during RLS analysis of ship and gridded data.
	   By default mgd77sniffer analyses both the full and decimated data sets then reports
	   RLS statistics for the higher correlation regression.
	  -Hb analyze both (default), report better of two.
	  -Hd to disable data decimation (equivalent to -H with no argument).
	  -Hf to force data decimation.
	-I Give one or more record numbers to specify ranges of data record that should be flagged as bad
	   prior to along-track analysis.  The flag information will be echoed out to E77 files.
	   May not be used for multiple cruises.
	-L Override mgd77sniffer default error detection limits. Supply path and filename of
	   the custom limits file. Rows not beginning with a valid MGD77 field abbreviation are
	   ignored. Field abbreviations are listed below in exact form under MGD77 FIELD INFO.
	   Multiple field limits may be modified using one default file, one field per line.
	   Field min, max, maxGradient and maxArea may be changed for each field. maxGradient
	   pertains to the gradient type selected using the -S option. maxArea is used by the
	   -G option as the threshold for flagging excessive offsets. Dump defaults (-Dd) to
	   view syntax or to quickly create an editable custom limits file.
	   Example custom default file contents (see below for field units):
		depth	0	11000	1000	4500
		mag	-800	800	-	-
		faa	-250	250	100	2500
	   Use a dash '-' to retain a default limit.
	   Hint: to test your custom limits, try: mgd77sniffer -Dl -L<yourlimitsfile>.
	-M Adjust navigation on land threshold (meters inland) [100].
	-N Use nautical units.
	-S Specify gradient type for along-track excessive slope checking.
	  -Sd Calculate change in z values along track (dz).
	  -Ss Calculate spatial gradients (dz/ds) [default].
	  -St Calculate time gradients (dz/dt).
	-T Set maximum acceptable distance gap between records (km) [5].
	   Set to zero to deactivate gap checking.
	-W Print out only certain warning types. Comma delimit any combination of c|g|o|s|t|v|x:
	   where (c) type code warnings, (g)radient out of range, (o)ffsets from grid (requires -G),
	   (s)peed out of range, (t)ime warnings, (v)alue out of range, (x) warning summaries.
	   By default ALL warning messages are printed. Not allowed with -D option.
	-V Run in verbose mode.

	-Z Flag regression statistics that are outside the specified confidence level.
	   (i.e., -Z5 flags coefficients m, b, rms, and r that fall outside 95%.)
	-b Output binary data for -D option.  Append d for double and s for single precision [double].

	-do Replace any NaNs in output data with <nodata>.
	-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>] Specify the grid interpolation mode.
	   (b = B-spline, c = bicubic, l = bilinear, n = nearest-neighbor) [Default is bicubic].
	   Append +a to switch off antialiasing (except for l) [Default: on].
	   Append +b<BC> to change boundary conditions.  <BC> can be either:
	     g for geographic, p for periodic, and n for natural boundary conditions.
	     For p and n you may optionally append x or y [default is both]:
	       x for periodic boundary conditions on x,
	       y for periodic boundary conditions on y.
	   [Default: Natural conditions, unless grid is known to be geographic].
	   Append +c to clip interpolated grid to input z-min/max [Default may exceed limits].
	   Append +t<threshold> to change the minimum weight in vicinity of NaNs. A threshold of
	   1.0 requires all nodes involved in interpolation to be non-NaN; 0.5 will interpolate
	   about half way from a non-NaN to a NaN node [Default: 0.5].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
