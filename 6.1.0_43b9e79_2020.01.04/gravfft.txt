usage: gmt gravfft <topo_grd> [<ingrid2>] -G<outgrid> [-C<n/wavelength/mean_depth/tbw>]
	[-D<density|grid>] [-E<n_terms>] [-F[f[+s]|b|g|v|n|e]] [-I<wbctk>]
	[-N[f|s|<n_columns>/<n_rows>][+a|d|l][+e|m|n][+t<width>][+v][+w<suffix>][+z[p]]] [-Q]
	[-T<te/rl/rm/rw>[/<ri>][+m]] [-V[<level>]] [-W<wd>] [-Z<zm>[/<zl>]] [-fg] [--PAR=<value>]

	topo_grd is the input grdfile with topography values
	-G Filename for output netCDF grdfile with gravity [or geoid] values

	OPTIONS:
	-C Compute admittance curves based on a theoretical model.
	   Append <n/wavelength/mean_depth/tbw> as specified below:
	   Total profile length in meters = <n> * <wavelength> (unless -Kx is set).
	   --> Rest of parameters are set within -T AND -Z options
	   Append dataflags (one or two) of tbw:
	     t writes "elastic plate" admittance.
	     b writes "loading from below" admittance.
	     w writes wavelength instead of wavenumber.
	-D Sets density contrast across surface (used when not -T).
	   Give a co-registered density grid for a variable density contrast [constant].
	-I Use <ingrid2> and <topo_grd> to estimate admittance|coherence and write
	   it to stdout (-G ignored if set). This grid should contain gravity or geoid
	   for the same region of <topo_grd>. Default computes admittance. Output
	   contains 3 or 4 columns. Frequency (wavelength), admittance (coherence)
	   one sigma error bar and, optionally, a theoretical admittance.
	   Append dataflags (one to three) of wbct:
	     w writes wavelength instead of wavenumber.
	     k Use km or wavelength unit [m].
	     c computes coherence instead of admittance.
	     b writes a forth column with "loading from below" 
	       theoretical admittance.
	     t writes a forth column with "elastic plate" 
	       theoretical admittance.
	-E Number of terms used in Parker's expansion [Default = 3].
	-F Specify desired geopotential field:
	   b = Bouguer anomalies (mGal).
	   f = Free-air anomalies (mGal) [Default].
	       Append +s to adjust for implied slab correction [none].
	   g = Geoid anomalies (m).
	   v = Vertical Gravity Gradient (VGG; 1 Eovtos = 0.1 mGal/km).
	   e = East deflections of the vertical (micro-radian).
	   n = North deflections of the vertical (micro-radian).
	-N Choose or inquire about suitable grid dimensions for FFT, and set modifiers.
	   Setting the FFT dimensions:
	     -Na will select dimensions promising the most accurate results.
	     -Nf will force the FFT to use the dimensions of the grid.
	     -Nm will select dimensions using the least work storage.
	     -Nr will select dimensions promising the most rapid calculation.
	     -Ns will list Singleton's [1967] recommended dimensions, then exit.
	     -N<n_columns>/<n_rows> will do FFT on array size <n_columns>/<n_rows> (Must be >= grid size).
	     Default chooses dimensions >= grid dimensions to optimize speed and accuracy of the FFT.
	   Append modifiers for removing a planar trend:
	     +d: Detrend data, i.e., remove best-fitting plane [Default].
	     +a: Only remove mean value.
	     +h: Only remove mid value, i.e., 0.5 * (max + min).
	     +l: Leave data alone.
	   Append modifiers for extending the grid via symmetries:
	     If FFT dimensions > grid dimensions, data are extended via edge point symmetry
	     and tapered to zero.  Several modifiers can be set to change this behavior:
	     +e: Extend data via edge point symmetry [Default].
	     +m: Extend data via edge mirror symmetry.
	     +n: Do NOT extend data.
	     +t<w>: Limit tapering to <w> % of the extended margins [100].
	     If +n is set then +t instead sets the boundary width of the interior
	     grid margin to be tapered [0].
	   Append modifiers for saving modified grid before or after the 2-D FFT is called:
	     +w[<suffix>] will write the intermediate grid passed to FFT after detrending/extension/tapering.
	       File name will have _<suffix> [tapered] inserted before file extension.
	     +z[p] will write raw complex spectrum to two separate grid files.
	       File name will have _real/_imag inserted before the file extensions.
	       Append p to store polar forms, using _mag/_phase instead.
	   Append modifiers for messages:
	     +v will report all suitable dimensions (except when -Nf is selected).
	   Warning: both -D -T...+m and -Q will implicitly set -N's +h.
	-Q Writes out a grid with the flexural topography (with z positive up)
	   whose average depth is set to the value given by -Z<zm>.
	-S Computes predicted geopotential (see -F) grid due to a subplate load
	   produced by the current bathymetry and the theoretical admittance.
	   The necessary parameters are set within -T and -Z options
	-T Computes the isostatic compensation. Input file is topo load.
	   Append elastic thickness and densities of load, mantle, and
	   water, all in SI units. Give average mantle depth via -Z
	   If the elastic thickness is > 1e10 it will be interpreted as the
	   flexural rigidity (by default it is computed from Te and Young modulus).
	   If an optional infill density <ri> != <rl> is appended we find an approximate solution.
	   Optionally, append +m to write a grid with the Moho's geopotential effect
	   (see -F) from model selected by -T.
	-W Specify water depth (or observation level) in m; append k for km.  Must be positive.
	-Z Specify Moho [and swell] average compensation depths.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-fg Convert geographic grids to meters using a "Flat Earth" approximation.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
