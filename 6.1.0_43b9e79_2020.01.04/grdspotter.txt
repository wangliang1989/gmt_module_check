gmt grdspotter [spotter] 6.1.0_43b9e79_2020.01.04 [64-bit] - Create CVA grid from a gravity or topography grid

usage: gmt grdspotter <ingrid> -E[+]<rottable> -G<CVAgrid> -I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]]
	-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r] [-A<agegrid>] [-D[i|p]<grdfile>] [-L<IDgrid>] [-M]
	[-N<upper_age>] [-Q<IDinfo>] [-S] [-Tt|-u<age>] [-V[<level>]] [-W<n_try]
	[-Z<z_min>[/<z_max>[/<z_inc>]]] [-ho[<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-r[g|p]] [--PAR=<value>]

	<ingrid> is the grid with topo or gravity
	-E Specify file with the rotations to be used (see documentation for format).
	   Append +i if you want to invert the finite rotations prior to use.
	   Alternative 1: Give a single rotation as plon/plat/prot.
	   Alternative 2: Give two plate IDs separated by a hyphen (e.g., PAC-MBL)
	   to extract that rotation from the GPlates rotation database.
	-G Specify file name for output CVA convolution grid.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.

	OPTIONS:
	-A Co-registered grid with upper ages to use [Default is flowlines for all ages].
	-D Set optional output grids:
	   -Di<file> Use flowlines to estimate data importance DI grid.
	   -Dp<file> Use flowlines to estimate predicted ages at node locations.
	-L Co-registered grid with chain ID for each node [Default ignores IDs].
	-M Do flowline calculations as needed rather than storing in memory.
	   You may have to use this option if -R is too large. Cannot be used with -W or -Z-slicing.
	-N Set upper age in m.y. for nodes whose plate age is NaN [180].
	-Q Either single ID to use or file with list of IDs [Default uses all IDs].
	   Each line would be TAG ID [w e s n] with optional zoom box.
	-S Normalize CVA grid to percentages of the CVA maximum.
	-T Set upper ages.  Repeatable, choose from:
	  -Tt truncate all ages to max age in stage pole model [Default extrapolates].
	  -Tu<age> After a node passes the -Z test, use this fixed age instead in CVA calculations.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-W Get <n_try> bootstrap estimates of maximum CVA location [Default is no bootstrapping].
	-Z Ignore nodes with z-value lower than z_min [0] and optionally larger than z_max [Inf].
	   Give z_min/z_max/z_inc to make CVA grids for each z-slice {Default makes 1 CVA grid].
	-h[i|o][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input or o for output only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output since none will be read.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
