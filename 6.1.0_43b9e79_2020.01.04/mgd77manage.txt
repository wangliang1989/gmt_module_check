gmt mgd77manage [mgd77] 6.1.0_43b9e79_2020.01.04 [64-bit] - Manage the content of MGD77+ files

usage: gmt mgd77manage <cruise(s)> [-Aa|c|d|D|e|E|g|i|n|t|T<info>[+f]] [-D<name1>,<name2>,...]
	[-E<no_char>] [-F] [-I<abbrev>/<name>/<units>/<size>/<scale>/<offset>/"comment"]
	[-Ne|f|k|M|n|u] [-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r]] [-V[<level>]] [-bi[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]]
	[-je|f|g] [-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>]] [--PAR=<value>]

	<cruises> can be one of five kinds of specifiers:
	1) 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g., 01010083, JA010010, etc., etc.
	2) 2-character <agency> codes which will return all cruises from each agency.
	3) 4-character <agency><vessel> codes, which will return all cruises from those vessels.
	4) A single =<list>, where <list> is a table with NGDC IDs, one per line.
	5) If nothing is specified we return all cruises in the data base.
	   [See the documentation for agency and vessel codes].

	OPTIONS:
	-A Append a new data column to the given files.  Append +f to overwrite an
	   existing column with same name with new data [Default will refuse if an
	   existing column has the same abbreviation as the new data].
	   The code letters are:
	   a: Give filename with a new column to add.  We expect a single-column file
	      with the same number of records as the MGD77 file.  Only one cruise can be set.
	      If filename is - we read from stdin.
	   c: Create a new column to be calculated from existing columns.  Add code:
	        m = IGRF total field, c = Carter correction, g = IGF ("normal gravity").
	        r = recomputed magnetic anomaly rmag = mtfx - IGRF total field.
	        Append x for which mtfx field to use (1 or 2) [1].
	        For g, optionally append 1-4 to select the gravity formula to use:
	        1 = Heiskanen 1924, 2 = International 1930, 3 = IGF1967, 4 = IGF1980.
	        [Default uses formula specified in the MGD77 header, or 4 if not valid].
	   d: Give filename with (dist [see -N], data) for a new column.  We expect a two-column file
	      with distances (in km) in first column and data values in 2nd.  Only one cruise can be set.
	      If filename is - we read from stdin.  Only records with matching distance will have data assigned.
	   D: Same as d but we interpolate between the dist,data pairs to fill in all data records.
	   e: Ingest MGD77 error/correction information (e77) produced by mgd77sniffer.  We will look
	      for the <cruise>.e77 file in the current directory or in $MGD77_HOME/E77.
	      By default we will apply recommended header (h) and systematic fixes (f) and set all data bit flags.
	      Append a combination of these flags to change the default accordingly:
	        h = Ignore all header recommendations
	        f = Ignore all systematic fixes recommendations
	        n = Ignore data record bitflags pertaining to navigation (time, lon, lat).
	        v = Ignore data record bitflags pertaining to data values.
	        s = Ignore data record bitflags pertaining to data slopes (gradients).
	      Use -DE to ignore the verification status of the e77 file [Default requires verification to be Y].
	      Note: Previous E77 information will be removed prior to processing this E77 information.
	   g: Sample a GMT grid along track. (also see -n; use -R to select a sub-region).
	      Append filename of the GMT grid.
	   i: Sample a Sandwell/Smith *.img Mercator grid along track (also see -n; use -R to select a sub-region).
	      Give filename and append comma-separated scale, mode, and optionally max latitude.
	      The scale (typically 0.1 or 1) is used to multiply after read; give mode as follows:
	        0 = img file with no constraint code, interpolate to get data at track.
	        1 = img file with constraints coded, interpolate to get data at track.
	        2 = img file with constraints coded, gets data only at constrained points, NaN elsewhere.
	        3 = img file with constraints coded, gets 1 at constraints, 0 elsewhere.
	        For mode 2|3 you may want to consider the -n+t<threshold> setting.
	   n: Give filename with (rec_no, data) for a new column.  We expect a two-column file
	      with record numbers (0 means 1st row) in first column and data values in 2nd.  Only one cruise can be set.
	      If filename is - we read from stdin.  Only records with matching record numbers will have data assigned.
	   t: Give filename with (abstime, data) for a new column.  We expect a two-column file
	      with dateTclock strings in first column and data values in 2nd.  Only one cruise can be set.
	      If filename is - we read from stdin.  Only records with matching times will have data assigned.
	   T: Same as t but we interpolate between the time, data pairs to fill in all data records.
	-D Delete the columns listed from all the cruise data files.
	   The columns are removed before any data are added.  It is not a substitute for -A...+f.
	   However, sometimes the shape of new data demands the old to be deleted first (you will be told).
	-E Give character used to fill empty/missing string columns [9]
	-F Force mode.  This allows you to even replace the standard MGD77 columns [only extended columns can be changed].
	-I In addition to the file information above, you must also specify column information:
	      abbrev:  Short, abbreviated word (lower case only), like satfaa (64 char max).
	      name:    Descriptive name, like "Geosat/ERS-1 Free-air gravity" (64 char max).
	      units:   Units for the column (e.g., mGal, gamma, km) (64 char max).
	      size:    Either t(ext), b(yte), s(hort), f(loat), i(nt), or d(ouble).
	      scale:   Multiply data by this scale before writing to mgd77+ file.
	      offset:  Add after scaling before writing to mgd77+ file.
	      comment: Any text (in double quotes) for information about column (128 char max).
	      -I is ignored by -Ae.
	   Note for text: Interpolation is not allowed, and "not-a-string" is created from -E.
	-N Append your choice for distance unit (if -Ad|D are set). Choose among:
	   m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)m, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, or s(u)rvey foot [Default is -Nk].
	    See -j for selecting distance calculation procedure.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-di Replace any <nodata> in input data with NaN.
	-j Set spherical distance calculation mode for modules that offer that flexibility.
	   Append f for Flat Earth, g for Great Circle [Default], and e for Ellipsoidal mode.
	-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>] Specify the grid interpolation mode.
	   (b = B-spline, c = bicubic, l = bilinear, n = nearest-neighbor) [Default is bicubic].
	   Append +a to switch off antialiasing (except for l) [Default: on].
	   Append +b<BC> to change boundary conditions.  <BC> can be either:
	     g for geographic, p for periodic, and n for natural boundary conditions.
	     For p and n you may optionally append x or y [default is both]:
	       x for periodic boundary conditions on x,
	       y for periodic boundary conditions on y.
	   [Default: Natural conditions, unless grid is known to be geographic].
	   Append +c to clip interpolated grid to input z-min/max [Default may exceed limits].
	   Append +t<threshold> to change the minimum weight in vicinity of NaNs. A threshold of
	   1.0 requires all nodes involved in interpolation to be non-NaN; 0.5 will interpolate
	   about half way from a non-NaN to a NaN node [Default: 0.5].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
