gmt x2sys_get [x2sys] 6.1.0_43b9e79_2020.01.04 [64-bit] - Get track listing from track index database

usage: gmt x2sys_get -T<TAG> [-C] [-D] [-F<fflags>] [-G] [-L[<list>][+i]] [-N<nflags>]
	[-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r]] [-V[<level>]] [--PAR=<value>]

	OPTIONS:
	-C Report center of each tile with tracks instead of track listing [Default is track files].
	-D Only report the track names and skip the report for each field.
	-F Comma-separated list of column field names that must ALL be present [Default is any field].
	-G Report global flags per track [Default reports for segments inside region].
	-L Setup mode: Return all pairs of tracks that might intersect given
	   the bin distribution.  Optionally, give file with a list of tracks.
	   Then, only pairs with at least one track from the list is output.
	   Append +i to include internal pairs in the list [external only].
	-N Comma-separated list of column field names that ALL must be missing.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead,
	     or use +e which is like +r but makes sure the region extends at least by 0.25 x <inc>.
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).
	   [Default region is the entire data domain].
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
