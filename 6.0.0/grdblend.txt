gmt grdblend [core] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Blend several partially overlapping grids into one larger grid

usage: gmt grdblend [<blendfile> | <grid1> <grid2> ...] -G<outgrid>
	-I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]] -R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r] [-Cf|l|o|u][+n|p]
	[-N<nodata>] [-Q] [-V[<level>]] [-W[z]] [-Z<scale>] [-f[i|o]<info>] [-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>]] [-r[g|p]] [--PAR=<value>]

	<blendfile> is an ASCII file (or stdin) with blending parameters for each input grid.
	   Each record has 1-3 items: filename [-R<inner_reg>] [<weight>].
	   Relative weights are <weight> [1] inside the given -R [grid domain] and cosine taper to 0
	   at actual grid -R. Skip <inner_reg> if inner region should equal the actual region.
	   Give a negative weight to invert the sense of the taper (i.e., |<weight>| outside given R.)
	   If <weight> is not given we default to 1.
	   Grids not in netCDF or native binary format will be converted first.
	   Grids not co-registered with the output -R -I will be resampled first.
	Alternatively, if all grids have the same weight (1) and inner region == outer region,
	then you may instead list all the grid files on the command line (e.g., patches_*.nc).
	Note: You must have at least 2 input grids for this mechanism to work.
	-G <outgrid> is the name of the final 2-D grid.
	   Only netCDF and native binary grid formats are directly supported;
	   other grid formats will be converted via grdconvert when blending is complete.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead [0].
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).

	OPTIONS:
	-C Clobber modes; no blending takes places as output node value is determined by the mode:
	     f: The first input grid determines the final value.
	     l: The lowest input grid value determines the final value.
	     o: The last input grid overrides any previous value.
	     u: The highest input grid value determines the final value.
	   Optionally, append +n (only consider clobbering if grid value is <= 0) or
	   +p (only consider clobbering if grid value is >= 0.0) [consider any value].
	-N Set value for nodes without constraints [Default is NaN].
	-Q Raster output without a leading grid header [Default writes GMT grid file].
	   Output grid must be in one of the native binary formats.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-W Write out weight-sum only [make blend grid].
	   Append z to write weight-sum w times z instead.
	-Z Multiply z-values by this scale before writing to file [1].
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>] Specify the grid interpolation mode.
	   (b = B-spline, c = bicubic, l = bilinear, n = nearest-neighbor) [Default is bicubic].
	   Append +a to switch off antialiasing (except for l) [Default: on].
	   Append +b<BC> to change boundary conditions.  <BC> can be either:
	     g for geographic, p for periodic, and n for natural boundary conditions.
	     For p and n you may optionally append x or y [default is both]:
	       x for periodic boundary conditions on x,
	       y for periodic boundary conditions on y.
	   [Default: Natural conditions, unless grid is known to be geographic].
	   Append +c to clip interpolated grid to input z-min/max [Default may exceed limits].
	   Append +t<threshold> to change the minimum weight in vicinity of NaNs. A threshold of
	   1.0 requires all nodes involved in interpolation to be non-NaN; 0.5 will interpolate
	   about half way from a non-NaN to a NaN node [Default: 0.5].
	   (-n is passed to grdsample if grids are not co-registered).
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
