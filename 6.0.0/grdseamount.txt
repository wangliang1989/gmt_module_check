gmt grdseamount [potential] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Create synthetic seamounts (Gaussian, parabolic, cone or disc, circular or elliptical)

usage: gmt grdseamount [infile(s)] -G<outgrid> -I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]]
	-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r] [-A[<out>/<in>]] [-Cc|d|g|p] [-De|f|k|M|n|u]
	[-E] [-F[<flattening>]] [-L[<hcut>]] [-M<list>] [-N<norm>] [-Q<bmode><fmode>] [-S<r_scale>]
	[-T<t0>[/<t1>/<dt>|<file>|<n>[+l]]] [-Z<base>] [-bi[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-di<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>]
	[-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]]
	[-r[g|p]] [--PAR=<value>]

	OPTIONS:
	Input contains x (or lon), y (or lat), radius, height for each seamount.
	   With -E we expect lon, lat, azimuth, semi-major, semi-minor, radius, height instead.
	   If -F (with no argument) is given then an extra column with flattening (0-1) is expected.
	   If -T is given then two extra columns with start and stop times are expected.
	-A Build a mAsk grid, append outside/inside values [1/NaN].
	   Here, height is ignored and -L, -N, -Q, -T and -Z are disallowed.
	-C Choose between c(one), d(isc), p(arabola) or g(aussian) model [cone].
	   If -C is not given the we default to Gaussian features.
	-D Specify horizontal distance unit used by input file if -fg is not used.  Choose among
	   e (meter), f (foot) k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile), or u (survey foot) [e].
	-E Elliptical data format [Default is Circular].
	   Read lon, lat, azimuth, major, minor, height (m) for each seamount.
	-F Seamounts are truncated.  Append flattening or expect it in an extra input column [no truncation].
	-G filename for output grdfile with constructed surface.  If -T is set then <outgrid>
	   must be a filename template that contains a floating point format (C syntax) and
	   we use the corresponding time (in units specified in -T) to generate the file names.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-L List area, volume, and mean height for each seamount; NO grid is created.
	   Optionally, append the noise-floor cutoff level [0].
	-M Give filename for output table with names of all grids produced.
	   If no filename is given then we write the list to stdout.
	-N Normalize grid so maximum grid height equals <norm>. Not allowed with -T.
	-Q Only used in conjunction with -T.  Append the two modes:
	   <bmode> to compute either (c)umulative or (i)ncremental volume through time.
	   <fmode> to assume a (g)aussian or (l)inear volume flux distribution.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead [0].
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).
	-S Sets ad hoc scale factor for radii [1].
	-T Specify start, stop, and time increments for sequence of calculations [one step, no time dependency].
	   For a single specific time, just give <start>. unit is years; append k for kyr and M for Myr.
	   For a logarithmic time scale, append +l and specify n steps instead of time increment.
	   To read a list of times from the first column in a file instead, use -T<tfile>.
	   This option implies two extra input columns with start and stop time for each seamount's life span.
	   Use -Q to select cumulative versus incremental loads.
	-Z Set the reference depth [0].  Not allowed for -Qi.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-di Replace any <nodata> in input data with NaN.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-fg Map units (lon, lat in degree, radius, major, minor in km).
	   [Default is Cartesian - no units are implied; but see -D].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
