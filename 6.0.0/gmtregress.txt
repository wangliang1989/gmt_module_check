usage: gmt gmtregress [<table>] [-A[<min>/<max>/<inc>]] [-C<level>] [-Ex|y|o|r] [-F<flags>] [-N1|2|r|w]
	[-S[r]] [-T[<min>/<max>/]<inc>[+n] [-V[<level>]] [-W[w][x][y][r]] [-a<col>=<name>[,...]]
	[-b[i|o][<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-d[i|o]<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]]
	[-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]] [-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [--PAR=<value>]

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-A Examine E as function of line slope; give angle range and increment [-90/+90/1].
	   Option -F is not required as no model will be returned; instead we return
	   records of (angle, E, slope, intercept) for all angles specified.
	-C Select level (in %) to use in confidence band calculations (see -Fc) [95].
	-E Regression type. Select how misfit should be measured:
	     x : Horizontally from data point to regression line.
	     y : Vertically from data point to regression line [Default].
	     o : Orthogonally from data point to regression line.
	     r : Use Reduced Major Axis area misfit.
	-F Append desired output columns in any order; choose from:
	     x : The x observations.
	     y : The y observations.
	     m : The estimated model values.
	     r : The estimated residuals.
	     c : The confidence limits (to add/subtract from m).
	     z : The standardized residuals (z-scores).
	     w : The outlier flags (1 or 0), or Reweighted Least Squares weights (for -Nw).
	         A value of 0 identifies an outlier.
	     Note: Cannot use y|r|z|w with -T. With -T, x means locations implied by -T.
	     [Default is xymrczw].
	     Alternatively, choose -Fp to output only the model parameters:
	     N meanX meanY angle misfit slope icept sigma_slope sigma_icept
	-N Append desired misfit norm; choose from:
	     1 : L-1 measure (mean absolute residuals).
	     2 : L-2 measure (mean squared residuals) [Default].
	     r : LMS robust measure (median of squared residuals).
	     w : RLS Reweighted L-2 measure (r followed by 2 after excluding outliers.
	-S Skip records identified as outliers on output. Append r to reverse mode and
	   only output the outlier records. Cannot be used with -T [output all records].
	-T Evaluate model at the equidistant points implied by the arguments.
	   If only -T<inc>[+n] is given we reset <min> and <max> to the extreme x-values
	   for each segment.  Append +n if <inc> is the number of t-values to produce instead.
	   For absolute time data, append a valid time unit (y|o|w|d|h|m|s) to the increment.
	   Alternatively, give a file with output times in the first column, or a comma-separated list.
	   Use -T0 to bypass model evaluation entirely.
	   [Default uses locations of input data to evaluate the model].
	-W Supply individual 1-sigma uncertainties for data points [no weights].
	   Append x for sigma_x, y for sigma_y, and r for x-y correlation.
	   We then expect 1-3 extra columns with these data in the given order.
	   Given a sigma, the weight will be computed via weight = 1/sigma.
	   Use -Ww if weights are precomputed and not given as 1-sigma values.
	   Except for -N1 we square the weights when computing misfits.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-a Give one or more comma-separated <col>=<name> associations
	   [Default selects all aspatial fields].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
