usage: gmt sample1d [<table>] [-A[f|m|p|r|R]+l] [-Fl|a|c|n][+1|2] [-N<time_col>]
	-T[<min>/<max>/]<inc>[<unit>][+n|a] [-V[<level>]] [-b[i|o][<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-d[i|o]<nodata>]
	[-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>] [-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]]
	[-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]]
	[-je|f|g] [-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]] [--PAR=<value>]

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	   The independent variable (see -N) must be monotonically in/de-creasing.
	-A Controls how the input track in <table> is resampled when -I..<unit> is selected:
	   f: Keep original points, but add intermediate points if needed [Default].
	   m: Same, but first follow meridian (along y) then parallel (along x).
	   p: Same, but first follow parallel (along x) then meridian (along y).
	   r: Resample at equidistant locations; input points not necessarily included.
	   R: Same, but adjust given spacing to fit the track length exactly.
	   Append +l to compute distances along rhumblines (loxodromes) [no].
	-F Set the interpolation mode.  Choose from:
	   l Linear interpolation.
	   a Akima spline interpolation.
	   c Cubic spline interpolation.
	   n No interpolation (nearest point).
	   Optionally, append +1 for 1st derivative or +2 for 2nd derivative.
	   [Default is -Fa].
	-N Give column number of the independent variable (time) [Default is 0 (first)].
	-T Make evenly spaced output time steps from <min> to <max> by <inc>.
	   Append +n to indicate <inc> is the number of t-values to produce over the range instead.
	   For absolute time resampling, append a valid time unit (y|o|w|d|h|m|s) to the increment and add +t.
	   For spatial resampling with distance computed from the first two columns, specify increment as
	   <inc>[<unit>] and append a geospatial distance unit (d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u) or c (for Cartesian distances).
	   See -A to control how the spatial resampling is done.
	   Optionally, append +a to add such internal distances as a final output column [no distances added].
	   Alternatively, give a file with output times in the first column, or a comma-separated list.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [2].
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-j Sets spherical distance calculation mode for modules that offer that flexibility.
	   Append f for Flat Earth, g for Great Circle [Default], and e for Ellipsoidal mode.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
