gmt grdlandmask [core] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Create a "wet-dry" mask grid from shoreline data base

usage: gmt grdlandmask -G<outgrid> -I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]] -R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r]
	[-A<min_area>[/<min_level>/<max_level>][+a[g|i][s|S]][+r|l][+p<percent>]] [-D<resolution>][+f] [-E[<bordervalues>]]
	[-N<maskvalues>] [-V[<level>]] [-r[g|p]] [-x[[-]<n>]]  [--PAR=<value>]

	-G Specify file name for output mask grid file.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead [0].
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).

	OPTIONS:
	-A Place limits on coastline features from the GSHHG data base.
	   Features smaller than <min_area> (in km^2) or of levels (0-4) outside the min-max levels
	   will be skipped [0/4 (4 means lake inside island inside lake)].
	   Select +a and one or two codes to control how Antarctica is handled:
	     Add g to use shelf ice grounding line for Antarctica coastline, or
	     Add i to use ice/water front for Antarctica coastline [Default].
	     Add s to skip Antarctica (all data south of 60S) [use all], or
	     Add S to skip anything BUT Antarctica (all data north of 60S) [use all].
	   Append +r to only get riverlakes from level 2, or +l to only get lakes [both].
	   Append +p<percent> to exclude features whose size is < <percent>% of the full-resolution feature [use all].
	-D Choose one of the following resolutions:
	     a - auto: select best resolution given selected region.
	     f - full resolution (may be very slow for large regions).
	     h - high resolution (may be slow for large regions).
	     i - intermediate resolution.
	     l - low resolution [Default].
	     c - crude resolution, for tasks that need crude continent outlines only.
	   Append +f to use a lower resolution should the chosen one not be available [abort].
	-E Indicate that nodes exactly on a polygon boundary are outside [inside].
	   Optionally append <border> or <cborder>/<lborder>/<iborder>/<pborder>.
	   We will then trace lines through the grid and reset the cells crossed by
	   the lines to the indicated values [Default is no line tracing].
	   This is a new option and is experimental.
	-N Give values to use if a node is outside or inside a feature.
	   Specify this information using 1 of 2 formats:
	     -N<wet>/<dry>.
	     -N<ocean>/<land>/<lake>/<island>/<pond>.
	   NaN is a valid entry.  Default values are 0/1/0/1/0 (i.e., 0/1).
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-x Limit the number of cores used in multi-threaded algorithms.
	   Default uses all available cores [4].
	   -x<n>  Select <n> cores (up to all available).
	   -x-<n> Select (all - <n>) cores (or at least 1).
