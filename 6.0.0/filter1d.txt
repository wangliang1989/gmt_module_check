gmt filter1d [core] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Time domain filtering of 1-D data tables

usage: gmt filter1d [<table>] -F<type><width>[<modifiers>] [-D<increment>] [-E] [-I<ignore_val>]
	[-L<lack_width>] [-N<t_col>] [-Q<q_factor>] [-S<symmetry>] [-T[<min>/<max>/]<inc>[<unit>][+e|n|a]]
	[-V[<level>]] [-b[i|o][<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-d[i|o]<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>]
	[-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]] [-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]]
	[-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]] [-je|f|g] [-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [-:[i|o]] [--PAR=<value>]

	-F Set filtertype.  Choose from convolution and non-convolution filters
	   and append filter <width> in same units as time column.
	   Append +h select high-pass filtering [Default is low-pass filtering].
	   Convolution filters:
	     b: Boxcar : Weights are equal.
	     c: Cosine arch : Weights given by cosine arch.
	     g: Gaussian : Weights given by Gaussian function.
	     f<name>: Custom : Weights given in one-column file <name>.
	   Non-convolution filters:
	     m: Median : Return the median value.
	     p: Maximum likelihood probability (mode) estimator : Return the mode.
	        By default, we return the average mode if more than one is found.
	        Append +l to return the lowest mode if multiple modes are found [return average].
	        Append +u to return the uppermost mode if multiple modes are found [return average].
	     l: Lower : Return minimum of all points.
	     L: Lower+ : Return minimum of all positive points.
	     u: Upper : Return maximum of all points.
	     U: Upper- : Return maximum of all negative points.
	   Upper case type B, C, G, M, P, F will use robust filter versions,
	   i.e., replace outliers (2.5 L1 scale (MAD) of median) with median during filtering.

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-D Set fixed increment when series is NOT equidistantly sampled.
	   Then <increment> will be the abscissae resolution, i.e., all abscissae
	   will be rounded off to a multiple of <increment>.
	-E Include ends of time series in output [Default loses half_width at each end].
	-I Ignore values; If an input value == <ignore_val> it will be set to NaN.
	-L Check for lack of data condition.  If input data has a gap exceeding
	   <width> then no output will be given at that point [Default does not check Lack].
	-N Set the column that contains the independent variable (time) [0].
	   The left-most column is # 0, the right-most is # (<n_cols> - 1).
	-Q Assess quality of output value by checking mean weight in convolution.
	   Enter <q_factor> between 0 and 1.  If mean weight < q_factor, output is
	   suppressed at this point [Default does not check quality].
	-S Check symmetry of data about window center.  Enter a factor
	   between 0 and 1.  If ( (abs(n_left - n_right)) / (n_left + n_right) ) > factor,
	   then no output will be given at this point [Default does not check Symmetry].
	-T Make evenly spaced output time steps from <min> to <max> by <inc> [Default uses input times].
	   Append +n to indicate <inc> is the number of t-values to produce instead.
	   If only <inc> is given, optionally append +e to keep increment exact [Default will adjust to fit range].
	   For absolute time filtering, append a valid time unit (y|o|w|d|h|m|s) to the increment.
	   For spatial filtering with distance computed from the first two columns, specify increment as
	   <inc>[<unit>] and append a geospatial distance unit (d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u) or c (for Cartesian distances).
	   Optionally, append +a to add such internal distances as a final output column [no distances added].
	   Alternatively, give a file with output times in the first column or a comma-separated list.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-j Sets spherical distance calculation mode for modules that offer that flexibility.
	   Append f for Flat Earth, g for Great Circle [Default], and e for Ellipsoidal mode.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
