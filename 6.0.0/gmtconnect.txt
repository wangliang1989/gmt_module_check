gmt gmtconnect [core] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Connect individual lines whose end points match within tolerance

usage: gmt gmtconnect [<table>] [-C<closedfile>] [-D[<template>]] [-L[<linkfile>]] [-Q<listfile>]
	-T[<dist>[<unit>][+s<sdist>]] [-V[<level>]] [-a<col>=<name>[,...]]
	[-b[i|o][<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-d[i|o]<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>] [-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]]
	[-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]]
	[-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]] [-:[i|o]] [--PAR=<value>]


	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-C Write already-closed polygons to a separate <closedfile> [gmtconnect_closed.txt],
	   with the remaining open segments written separately to stdout.
	   [All segments are written to a single output file; but see -D].
	-D Write individual segments to separate files [Default writes one multisegment file to stdout].
	   Append file name template which MUST contain a C-format specifier for an integer (e.g., %d).
	   If the format also includes a %c string BEFORE the %d part we replace it with C(losed) or O(pen)
	   [Default uses gmtconnect_segment_%d.txt].
	-L Write link information (seg id, begin/end nearest seg id, end, and distance) to file [gmtconnect_link.txt].
	   Link output excludes duplicates and segments already forming a closed polygon.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-T Set cutoff distance to determine if a segment is closed.
	   Append e (meter), f (foot), k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile), u (survey foot)
	   d (arc degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc second) [e].
	   Spherical distances are based on great-circle calculations;
	   see -j<mode> for other modes of measurements.
	   If two lines has endpoints closer than this cutoff they will be joined.
	   Optionally, append +s<sdist> which adds the requirement that the second closest
	   match must exceed <sdist> (must be in the same units as <cutoff>).
	   If no arguments are given the we close all polygons regardless of the gaps.
	-Q Used with -D to write names of files to a list.  Optionally give listfile name [gmtconnect_list.txt].
	   Embed %c in the list name to write two separate lists: one for C(losed) and one for O(pen).
	-a Give one or more comma-separated <col>=<name> associations
	   [Default selects all aspatial fields].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [2].
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
