gmt mgd77convert [mgd77] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Convert MGD77 data to other formats

usage: gmt mgd77convert <cruise(s)> -Fa|c|m|t -Ta|c|m|t[+f] [-C] [-D] [-L[e][w][+l]] [-V[<level>]] [--PAR=<value>]

	<cruises> can be one of five kinds of specifiers:
	1) 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g., 01010083, JA010010, etc., etc.
	2) 2-character <agency> codes which will return all cruises from each agency.
	3) 4-character <agency><vessel> codes, which will return all cruises from those vessels.
	4) A single =<list>, where <list> is a table with NGDC IDs, one per line.
	5) If nothing is specified we return all cruises in the data base.
	   [See the documentation for agency and vessel codes].
	   [Files are read from data repositories and written to current directory]
	-F Convert from a file that is either (a) MGD77 ASCII, (c) MGD77+ netCDF, (m) MGD77T ASCII, or (t) plain table.
	   Use -FC to recover the original MGD77 setting from the MGD77+ file [Default applies E77 corrections].
	-T Convert to a file that is either (a) MGD77 ASCII, (c) MGD77+ netCDF, (m) MGD77T ASCII, or (t) plain table.
	   By default we will refuse to overwrite existing files.  Append +f to force an override this policy.

	OPTIONS:
	-C Convert from NGDC (*.h77, *.a77) to *.mgd77 format; no other options allowed.
	   Give one or more names of h77-files, a77-files, or just cruise prefixes.
	-D Select high-resolution, 4-byte storage for mag, diur, faa, eot, and msd with precision
	   of 10 fTesla, 1 nGal, 0.01 mm [Default is 2-byte with 0.1 nTesla, 0.1 mGal, m precision].
	-L Set log level and destination setting for verification reporting.  Append a combination
	   of w for warnings and e for errors, and append +l to send log to stdout [Default is stderr].
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
