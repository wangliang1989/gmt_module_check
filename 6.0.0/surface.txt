gmt surface [core] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Grid table data using adjustable tension continuous curvature splines

usage: gmt surface [<table>] -G<outgrid> -I<xinc>[<unit>][+e|n][/<yinc>[<unit>][+e|n]]
	-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r] [-A<aspect_ratio>|m] [-C<convergence_limit>]
	[-D<breakline>] [-Ll<limit>] [-Lu<limit>] [-M<radius>[<unit>]] [-N<n_iterations>] [-Q] [-S<search_radius>[m|s]]
	[-T[i|b]<tension>] [-V[<level>]] [-W[<logfile>]] [-Z<over_relaxation_parameter>]
	[-bi[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-di<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>]
	[-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]]
	[-r[g|p]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]] [-x[[-]<n>]] [-:[i|o]] [--PAR=<value>]

	-G sets output grid file name.
	-I Specify increment(s) and optionally append units or flags.
	   Full syntax is <xinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n][/<yinc>[d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u][+e|n]]]
	   For geographic regions in degrees you can optionally append units from this list:
	   (d)egree [Default], (m)inute, (s)econd, m(e)ter, (f)oot, (k)ilometer, (M)ile, (n)autical mile, s(u)rvey foot.
	   Append +e to adjust the region to fit increments [Adjust increment to fit domain].
	   Alternatively, specify number of nodes by appending +n. Then, the increments
	   are calculated from the given domain and node-registration settings
	   (see Appendix B for details).  Note: If -R<grdfile> was used then -I
	   (and -R and maybe -r) have been set; use -I to override those increments.
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead [0].
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-A Set aspect-ratio> [Default = 1 gives an isotropic solution],
	   i.e., xinc and yinc assumed to give derivatives of equal weight; if not, specify
	   <aspect_ratio> such that yinc = xinc / <aspect_ratio>.
	   If gridding lon,lat use -Am to set <aspect_ratio> = cosine(middle of lat range).
	-C Set final convergence limit; iteration stops when max |change| < <convergence_limit>
	   Default will choose 0.0001 of the rms of your z data after removing L2 plane (100 ppm precision).
	   Enter your own convergence limit in the same units as your z data.
	-D Use xyz data in the <breakline> file as a 'soft breakline'.
	-L Constrain the range of output values:
	   -Ll<limit> specifies lower limit; forces solution to be >= <limit>.
	   -Lu<limit> specifies upper limit; forces solution to be <= <limit>.
	   <limit> can be any number, or the letter d for min (or max) input data value,
	   or the filename of a grid with bounding values.  [Default solution is unconstrained].
	   Example: -Ll0 enforces a non-negative solution.
	-M Set maximum radius for masking the grid away from data points [no masking].
	   Append e (meter), f (foot), k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile), u (survey foot)
	   d (arc degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc second) [e].
	   Spherical distances are based on great-circle calculations;
	   see -j<mode> for other modes of measurements.
	   For Cartesian grids with different x and y units you may append <xlim>/<ylim>;
	   this fills all nodes within the rectangular area of the given half-widths.
	   One can also achieve the rectangular selection effect by using the -M<n_cells>c
	   form. Here n_cells means the number of cells around the data point. As an example,
	   -M0c means that only the cell where point lies is retained, -M1c keeps one cell
	   beyond that (i.e. makes a 3x3 neighborhood), and so on.
	-N Set max <n_iterations> in the final cycle; default = 500.
	-S Set <search_radius> to initialize grid; default = 0 will skip this step.
	   This step is slow and not needed unless grid dimensions are pathological;
	   i.e., have few or no common factors.
	   Append m or s to give <search_radius> in minutes or seconds.
	-T Add Tension to the gridding equation; use a value between 0 and 1.
	   Default = 0 gives minimum curvature (smoothest; bicubic) solution.
	   1 gives a harmonic spline solution (local max/min occur only at data points).
	   Typically, 0.25 or more is good for potential field (smooth) data;
	   0.5-0.75 or so for topography.  We encourage you to experiment.
	   Prepend b to set tension in boundary conditions only;
	   Prepend i to set tension in interior equations only;
	   No appended letter sets tension for both to same value.
	-Q Query for grid sizes that might run faster than your selected -R -I.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-W Write convergence information to log file [surface_log.txt]
	-Z Set <over_relaxation parameter>.  Default = 1.4.  Use a value
	   between 1 and 2.  Larger number accelerates convergence but can be unstable.
	   Use 1 if you want to be sure to have (slow) stable convergence.
	-a Give one or more comma-separated <col>=<name> associations
	   [Default selects all aspatial fields].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [3].
	-di Replace any <nodata> in input data with NaN.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-r Set (g)ridline- or (p)ixel-registration [Just -r sets pixel registration].
	   If not given we default to gridline registration.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-x Limit the number of cores used in multi-threaded algorithms.
	   Default uses all available cores [4].
	   -x<n>  Select <n> cores (up to all available).
	   -x-<n> Select (all - <n>) cores (or at least 1).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
	   Note: Geographic data with 360-degree range use periodic boundary condition in longitude.
