gmt originater [spotter] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Associate seamounts with nearest hotspot point sources

usage: gmt originater [<table>] -E<rottable>[+i] -F<hotspottable>[+d] [-D<d_km>] [-H] [-L[<flag>]]
	[-N<upper_age>] [-Qr/t] [-S<n_hs>] [-T] [-V[<level>]] [-W<maxdist>] [-Z]
	[-bi[<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-d[i|o]<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]]
	[-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]] [-:[i|o]] [--PAR=<value>]

	-E Specify file with the rotations to be used (see documentation for format).
	   Append +i if you want to invert the finite rotations prior to use.
	   Alternative 1: Give a single rotation as plon/plat/prot.
	   Alternative 2: Give two plate IDs separated by a hyphen (e.g., PAC-MBL)
	   to extract that rotation from the GPlates rotation database.
	-F Specify file name for hotspot locations.
	   Append +d if we should look for hotspot drift tables.
	   If found then we interpolate to get hotspot location as a function of time [fixed].

	OPTIONS:
	<table> (in ASCII, binary, or netCDF) has 5 or more columns.  If no file(s) is given,
	   standard input is read.  Expects (x,y,z,r,t) records, with t in Ma.
	-D Set sampling interval in km along tracks [5].
	-L Output information for closest approach for nearest hotspot only (ignores -S).
	   -Lt gives (time, dist, z) [Default].
	   -Lw gives (omega, dist, z).
	   -Ll gives (lon, lat, time, dist, z).
	   dist is in km; use upper case T,W,L to get dist in spherical degrees.
	-N Set age (in m.y.) for seafloor where age == NaN [180].
	-Q Input files has (x,y,z) only. Append constant r/t to use.
	-S Report the <n_hs> closest hotSpots [1].
	-T Truncate seamount ages exceeding the upper age set with -N [no truncation].
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-W Report seamounts whose closest encounter to a hotspot is less than <maxdist> km
	   [Default reports for all seamounts].
	-Z Write hotspot ID number rather than hotspot TAG.
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [5].
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
