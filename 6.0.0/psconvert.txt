gmt psconvert [core] 6.0.0 [64-bit] - Convert [E]PS file(s) to other formats using Ghostscript

usage: gmt psconvert <psfile1> <psfile2> <...> -A[+g<fill>][+m<margins>][+n][+p[<pen>]][+r][+s[m]|S<width[u]>[/<height>[u]]][+u]
	[-C<gs_command>] [-D<dir>] [-E<resolution>] [-F<out_name>] [-G<gs_path>] [-H<factor>] [-I] [-L<listfile>] [-Mb|f<psfile>]
	[-P] [-Q[g|p|t]1|2|4] [-S] [-Tb|e|E|f|F|g|G|j|m|s|t[+m]] [-V[<level>]]
	[-W[+a<mode>[<alt]][+f<minfade>/<maxfade>][+g][+k][+l<lodmin>/<lodmax>][+n<name>][+o<folder>][+t<title>][+u<URL>]]
	[-Z] [--PAR=<value>]
	Works by modifying the page size in order that the resulting
	image will have the size specified by the BoundingBox.
	As an option, a tight BoundingBox may be computed.

	<psfile(s)> PostScript file(s) to be converted.

	OPTIONS:
	-A Adjust the BoundingBox to the minimum required by the image contents.
	   Append +g<paint> to paint the BoundingBox [no paint].
	   Append +m<margin(s)> to enlarge the BoundingBox, with <margin(s)> being
	     <off>[u] for uniform margin for all 4 sides,
	     <xoff>[u]/<yoff>[u] for separate x- and y-margins, or
	     <woff>[u]/<eoff>[u]/<soff>[u]/<noff>[u] for separate w-,e-,s-,n-margins.
	   Append +n to leave the BoundingBox as is.
	   Append +p[<pen>] to outline the BoundingBox [default,black].
	   Append +r to force rounding of HighRes BoundingBox instead of ceil.
	   Append +s[m]<width[u]>[/<height>[u]] option the select a new image size
	     but maintaining the DPI set by -E (Ghostscript does the re-interpolation work).
	     Use +sm to only change size if figure size exceeds the new maximum size(s).
	     Append measurement unit u (c|i|p) [c].
	   Alternatively, use -A+S<scale> to scale the image by the <scale> factor.
	   Append +u to strip out time-stamps (produced by GMT -U options).
	-C Specify a single, custom option that will be passed on to Ghostscript
	   as is. Repeat to add several options [none].
	-D Set an alternative output directory (which must exist)
	   [Default is same directory as PS files].
	   Use -D. to place the output in the current directory.
	-E Set raster resolution in dpi [default = 720 for images in a PDF, 300 for other formats].
	-F Force the output file name. By default output names are constructed
	   using the input names as base, which are appended with an appropriate
	   extension. Use this option to provide a different name, but WITHOUT
	   extension. Extension is still determined and appended automatically.
	-G Full path to your Ghostscript executable.
	   NOTE: Under Unix systems this is generally not necessary.
	   Under Windows, Ghostscript path is fished from the registry.
	   If this fails you can still add the GS path to system's path
	   or give the full path here.
	   (e.g., -G/some/unusual/dir/bin/gs).
	-H Temporarily increase dpi by <factor>, rasterize, then downsample [no downsampling].
	   Used to improve raster image quality, especially for lower raster resolutions.
	-I Ghostscript versions >= 9.00 change gray-shades by using ICC profiles.
	   GS 9.05 and above provide the '-dUseFastColor=true' option to prevent that
	   and that is what psconvert does by default, unless option -I is set.
	   Note that for GS >= 9.00 and < 9.05 the gray-shade shifting is applied
	   to all but PDF format. We have no solution to offer other than ... upgrade GS
	-L The <listfile> is an ASCII file with names of files to be converted.
	-M Sandwich current psfile between background and foreground plots:
	     -Mb Append the name of a background PostScript plot [none].
	     -Mf Append name of foreground PostScript plot [none].
	-P Force Portrait mode. All Landscape mode plots will be rotated back
	   so that they show unrotated in Portrait mode.
	   This is practical when converting to image formats or preparing
	   EPS or PDF plots for inclusion in documents.
	-Q Anti-aliasing setting for (g)raphics or (t)ext; append size (1,2,4) of sub-sampling box.
	   For PDF and EPS output, default is no anti-aliasing, which is the same as specifying size 1.
	   For raster formats the defaults are -Qg4 -Qt4 unless overridden explicitly.
	   Optionally, use -Qp to create a GeoPDF (requires -Tf).
	-S Apart from executing it, also writes the Ghostscript command to
	   standard error and keeps all intermediate files.
	-T Set output format [default is jpeg]:
	   b means BMP.
	   e means EPS.
	   E means EPS with setpagedevice command.
	   f means PDF.
	   F means multi-page PDF (requires -F).
	   g means PNG.
	   G means PNG (transparent where nothing is plotted).
	   j means JPEG.
	   m means PPM.
	   s means SVG [if supported by your Ghostscript version].
	   t means TIF.
	   For b, g, j, and t, append +m to get a monochrome (grayscale) image [color].
	   The EPS format can be combined with any of the other formats.
	   For example, -Tef creates both an EPS and PDF file.
	-V Provide progress report [default is silent] and show the
	   gdal_translate command, in case you want to use this program
	   to create a geoTIFF file.
	-W Write a ESRI type world file suitable to make (e.g.,) .tif files
	   recognized as geotiff by software that know how to do it. Be aware,
	   however, that different results are obtained depending on the image
	   contents and if the -B option has been used or not. The trouble with
	   -B is that it creates a frame and very likely its ticks and annotations
	   introduces pixels outside the map data extent. As a consequence,
	   the map extent estimation will be wrong. To avoid this problem, use
	   the --MAP_FRAME_TYPE=inside option which plots all annotation-related
	   items inside the image and therefore does not compromise the coordinate
	   computations. The world file naming follows the convention of jamming
	   a 'w' in the file extension. So, if the output is tif (-Tt) the world
	   file is a .tfw, for jpeg a .jgw, and so on.
	   Use -W+g to do a system call to gdal_translate and produce a true
	   geoTIFF image right away. The output file will have the extension
	   .tiff. See the man page for other 'gotchas'. Automatically sets -A -P.
	   Use -W+k to create a minimalist KML file that allows loading the
	   image in Google Earth. Note that for this option the image must be
	   in geographical coordinates. If not, a warning is issued but the
	   KML file is created anyway.
	   Several modifiers allow you to specify the content in the KML file:
	   +a<altmode>[<altitude>] sets the altitude mode of this layer, where
	      <altmode> is one of 5 recognized by Google Earth:
	      G clamped to the ground [Default].
	      g Append altitude (in m) relative to ground.
	      A Append absolute altitude (in m).
	      s Append altitude (in m) relative to seafloor.
	      S clamped to the seafloor.
	   +f<minfade>/<maxfade>] sets distances over which we fade from opaque
	     to transparent [no fading].
	   +l<minLOD>/<maxLOD>] sets Level Of Detail when layer should be
	     active [always active]. Image goes inactive when there are fewer
	     than minLOD pixels or more than maxLOD pixels visible.
	     -1 means never invisible.
	   +n<layername> sets the name of this particular layer
	     ["GMT Image Overlay"].
	   +o<foldername> sets the name of this particular folder
	     ["GMT Image Folder"].  This yields a KML snipped without header/trailer.
	   +t<doctitle> sets the document name ["GMT KML Document"].
	   +u<URL> prepands this URL to the name of the image referenced in the
	     KML [local file].
	   Escape any +? modifier inside strings with \.
	-Z Remove input PostScript file(s) after successful conversion.
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
