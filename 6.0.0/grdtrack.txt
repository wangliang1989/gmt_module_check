usage: gmt grdtrack -G<grid1> -G<grid2> ... [<table>] [-A[f|m|p|r|R][+l]] [-C<length>[u]/<ds>[/<spacing>][+a][+l|r][+v]]
	[-D<dfile>] [-E<line1>[,<line2>,...][+a<az>][+d][+i<step>[u]][+l<length>[u]][+n<np][+o<az>][+r<radius>[u]]]
	[-N] [-R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north>[+r]] [-S[<method>][<modifiers>]] [-T<radius>[unit]>[+e|p]] [-V[<level>]]
	[-Z] [-b[i|o][<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>]
	[-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]] [-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]]
	[-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]] [-je|f|g] [-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>]]
	[-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]] [-:[i|o]] [--PAR=<value>]

	-G Set the name of a more 2-D binary data set to sample.
	   See below if the file is a Sandwell/Smith Mercator grid (IMG format).
	   Alternatively, use -G+l<list> to pass a list of file names.
	      Give filename and append comma-separated scale, mode, and optionally max latitude.
	      The scale (typically 0.1 or 1) is used to multiply after read; give mode as follows:
	        0 = img file with no constraint code, interpolate to get data at track.
	        1 = img file with constraints coded, interpolate to get data at track.
	        2 = img file with constraints coded, gets data only at constrained points, NaN elsewhere.
	        3 = img file with constraints coded, gets 1 at constraints, 0 elsewhere.
	        For mode 2|3 you may want to consider the -n+t<threshold> setting.
	   Repeat -G for as many grids as you wish to sample.

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is an multicolumn ASCII file with (x, y) in the first two columns.
	-A Controls how the input track in <table> is resampled when -C or -E are selected:
	   f: Keep original points, but add intermediate points if needed [Default].
	   m: Same, but first follow meridian (along y) then parallel (along x).
	   p: Same, but first follow parallel (along x) then meridian (along y).
	   r: Resample at equidistant locations; input points not necessarily included.
	   R: Same, but adjust given spacing to fit the track length exactly.
	   Append +l to compute distances along rhumblines (loxodromes) [no].
	-C Create equidistant cross-profiles from input line segments. Append 2-3 parameters:
	   1. <length>[u]: The full-length of each cross profile.
	     Append distance unit u (d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u); it also applies to <ds>, <spacing>.
	     Default unit is meter (geographic grids) or user unit (Cartesian grids).
	   2. <dz>: The sampling interval along the cross-profiles, in units of u.
	   3. Optionally, append /<spacing> to set the spacing between cross-profiles [Default use input locations].
	   Append +a to alternate direction of cross-profiles [Default orients all the same way].
	   Append +l or +r to only use the left or right halves of the profiles [entire profile].
	   Append +v to adjust direction of cross-profiles for E-W or S-N viewing [Default orients all the same way].
	   Output columns are x, y, dist, az, z1, z2, ...zn (n is number of grids).
	   Default samples the grid(s) at the input data points.
	-D Save [resampled] input lines to a separate file <dfile>.  Requires -C.
	   Output columns are lon, lat, dist, az, z1, z2, ..., zn
	-E Set quick paths based on <line1>[,<line2>,...]. Give start and stop coordinates for
	   each line segment.  The format of each <line> is <start>/<stop>, where <start> or <stop>
	   are <lon/lat> or a 2-character XY key that uses the "pstext"-style justification format
	   format to specify a point on the map as [LCR][BMT].  In addition, you can use Z-, Z+ to mean
	   the global minimum and maximum locations in the grid.  Note: No track file is read.
	   Append +i<inc>[u] to set the sampling increment [Default is 0.5 x min of (x_inc, y_inc)]
	   Use +d to insert an extra output column with distances following the coordinates.
	   Instead of <start/stop>, give <origin> and append +a|o|l|n|r as required:
	     +a<az> defines a profiles from <origin> in <az> direction. Add +l<length>[u].
	     +o<az> is like +a but centers profile on <origin>. Add +l<length>[u].
	     +r<radius>[u] defines a circle about <origin>. Add +i<inc> or +n<np>.
	     +n<np> sets the number of output points and computes <inc> from <length>.
	     Note: [u] is optional unit.  Only ONE unit type can be used throughout.
	     Mixing of units is not allowed [Default unit is km if geographic].
	-N Do NOT skip points outside the grid domain [Default only returns points inside domain].
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead [0].
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-S In conjunction with -C, compute a single stacked profile from all profiles across each segment.
	   Append which method should be used when performing the stacking:
	   a = mean, m = median, p = mode, l = lower, L = lower of +ve values, u = upper, U = upper of -ve values [a].
	   The modifiers control what is being written; choose one or more among
	     +a : Append stacked values to all cross-profiles.
	     +d : Append stack deviations to all cross-profiles.
	     +r : Append data residuals (data - stack) to all cross-profiles.
	     +s[<file>] : Save stacked profile to <file> [stacked_profile.txt].
	     +c<fact> : Compute envelope as +/- <fact>*deviation [2].
	   Note: Deviations depend on method and are L1 scale (m), st.dev (a), LMS scale (p), or half-range (u-l)/2.
	-T If nearest node is NaN, search outwards to find the nearest non-NaN node and return it instead.
	   Append +e to append 3 extra columns: lon, lat of nearest node and its distance from original node.
	   Append +p to instead replace input lon, lat with that of nearest node.
	   Can only be used with a single non-IMG grid and incompatible with -A, -C, -D, -E, -S.
	-Z Only output z-values [Default gives all columns].
	-a Give one or more comma-separated <col>=<name> associations
	   [Default selects all aspatial fields].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [2].
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-j Sets spherical distance calculation mode for modules that offer that flexibility.
	   Append f for Flat Earth, g for Great Circle [Default], and e for Ellipsoidal mode.
	-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+b<BC>][+c][+t<threshold>] Specify the grid interpolation mode.
	   (b = B-spline, c = bicubic, l = bilinear, n = nearest-neighbor) [Default is bicubic].
	   Append +a to switch off antialiasing (except for l) [Default: on].
	   Append +b<BC> to change boundary conditions.  <BC> can be either:
	     g for geographic, p for periodic, and n for natural boundary conditions.
	     For p and n you may optionally append x or y [default is both]:
	       x for periodic boundary conditions on x,
	       y for periodic boundary conditions on y.
	   [Default: Natural conditions, unless grid is known to be geographic].
	   Append +c to clip interpolated grid to input z-min/max [Default may exceed limits].
	   Append +t<threshold> to change the minimum weight in vicinity of NaNs. A threshold of
	   1.0 requires all nodes involved in interpolation to be non-NaN; 0.5 will interpolate
	   about half way from a non-NaN to a NaN node [Default: 0.5].
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
