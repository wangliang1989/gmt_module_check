usage: gmt project [<table>] -C<ox>/<oy> [-A<azimuth>] [-E<bx>/<by>] [-F<flags>] [-G<dist>[/<colat>][+h]]
	[-L[w|<l_min>/<l_max>]] [-N] [-Q] [-S] [-T<px>/<py>] [-V[<level>]] [-W<w_min>/<w_max>] [-Z<major>/<minor>/<azimuth>[+e]]
	[-b[i|o][<ncol>][t][w][+l|b]] [-d[i|o]<nodata>] [-e[~]<pattern>] [-f[i|o]<info>] [-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[<col>]z<gap>[<unit>][+n|p]]
	[-h[i|o][<nrecs>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>]] [-i<cols>[+l][+s<scale>][+o<offset>][,...][,t[<word>]]]
	[-o<cols>[,...][t[<word>]]] [-s[<cols>][+a|r]] [-:[i|o]] [--PAR=<value>]

	project will read stdin or file, and does not want input if -G option.
	The projection may be defined in (only) one of three ways:
	   (1) by a center -C and an azimuth -A,
	   (2) by a center -C and end point of the path -E,
	   (3) by a center -C and a roTation pole position -T.
	   In a spherical projection [default], all cases place the central meridian
	   of the transformed coordinates (p,q) through -C (p = 0 at -C).  The equator
	   of the (p,q) system (line q = 0) passes through -C and makes an angle
	   <azimuth> with North (case 1), or passes through -E (case 2), or is
	   determined by the pole -T (case 3).  In (3), point -C need not be on equator.
	   In a Cartesian [-N option] projection, p = q = 0 at -O in all cases;
	   (1) and (2) orient the p axis, while (3) orients the q axis.

	-C Set the location of the center to be <ox>/<oy>.

	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-A Set the option (1) Azimuth, (<azimuth> in degrees CW from North).
	-D Force the location of the Discontinuity in the r coordinate;
	   -Dd (dateline) means [-180 < r < 180], -Dg (greenwich) means [0 < r < 360].
	   The default does not check; in spherical case this usually results in [-180,180].
	-E Set the option (2) location of end point E to be <bx>/<by>.
	-F Indicate what output you want as one or more of xyzpqrs in any order;
	   where x,y,[z] refer to input data locations and optional values,
	   p,q are the coordinates of x,y in the projection's coordinate system,
	   r,s is the projected position of x,y (taking q = 0) in the (x,y) coordinate system.
	   p,q may be scaled from degrees into kilometers by the -Q option.  See -L, -Q, -W.
	   Note z refers to all input data columns beyond the required x,y
	   [Default is all fields, i.e., -Fxyzpqrs].
	   If -G is set, -F is not available and output defaults to rsp.
	-G Generate (r,s,p) points along profile every <dist> units. (No input data used.)
	   If E given, will generate from C to E; else must give -L<l_min>/<l_max> for length.
	   Optionally, append /<colat> for a small circle path through C and E (requires -C -E) [90].
	   Finally, append +h if you want information about the pole in a segment header [no header].
	-L Check the Length along the projected track and use only certain points.
	   -Lw will use only those points Within the span from C to E (Must have set -E).
	   -L<l_min>/<l_max> will only use points whose p is [l_min <= p <= l_max].
	   Default uses all points.  Note p = 0 at C and increases toward E in <azimuth> direction.
	-N Flat Earth mode; a Cartesian projection is made.  Default is spherical.
	-Q Convert to Map units, so x,y,r,s are degrees,
	   while p,q,dist,l_min,l_max,w_min,w_max are km.
	   If not set, then p,q,dist,l_min,l_max,w_min,w_max are assumed to be in same units as x,y,r,s.
	-S Output should be Sorted into increasing p value.
	-T Set the option (3) location of the roTation pole to the projection to be <px>/<py>.
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-W Check the width across the projected track and use only certain points.
	   This will use only those points whose q is [w_min <= q <= w_max].
	   Note that q is positive to your LEFT as you walk from C toward E in <azimuth> direction.
	-Z With -G and -C, generate an ellipse of given major and minor axes (in km if geographic) and azimuth
	   of major axis. Append +e for adjusting increment to fix perimeter exactly [use increment as given in -G].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type> in binary file(s) [2].
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
