	OPTIONS:
	<table> is one or more data files (in ASCII, binary, netCDF).
	   If no files are given, standard input is read.
	-A Place limits on coastline features from the GSHHG data base.
	   Features smaller than <min_area> (in km^2) or of levels (0-4) outside the min-max levels
	   will be skipped [0/4 (4 means lake inside island inside lake)].
	   Select +a and one or two codes to control how Antarctica is handled:
	     Add g to use shelf ice grounding line for Antarctica coastline, or
	     Add i to use ice/water front for Antarctica coastline [Default].
	     Add s to skip Antarctica (all data south of 60S) [use all], or
	     Add S to skip anything BUT Antarctica (all data north of 60S) [use all].
	   Append +r to only get riverlakes from level 2, or +l to only get lakes [both].
	   Append +p<percent> to exclude features whose size is < <percent>% of the full-resolution feature [use all].
	   (ignored  unless -N is set).
	-C Pass locations that are within <dist> of any point in the ASCII <ptfile>.
	   Append e (meter), f (foot), k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile), u (survey foot)
	   d (arc degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc second) [e].
	   Spherical distances are based on great-circle calculations;
	   see -j<mode> for other modes of measurements.
	   Give distance as 0 if 3rd column of <ptfile> has individual distances.
	   Use -R -J to compute mapped Cartesian distances in cm, inch, m, or points [cm].
	-D Choose one of the following resolutions: (Ignored unless -N is set).
	     f - full resolution (may be very slow for large regions).
	     h - high resolution (may be slow for large regions).
	     i - intermediate resolution.
	     l - low resolution [Default].
	     c - crude resolution, for tasks that need crude continent outlines only.
	   Append +f to use a lower resolution should the chosen one not be available [abort].
	-E Indicate if points exactly on a polygon boundary are inside or outside.
	   Append f and/or n to modify the -F option or -N option, respectively,
	   to consider such points to be outside the feature [inside].
	-F Pass locations that are inside the polygons in the ASCII <polygon> file.
	-G Pass locations that are inside the non-zero, non-NaN nodes of the grid <gridmask>.
	-I Reverse the tests, i.e., pass locations outside the region.
	   Supply a combination of cflrz where each flag means:
	     c will pass locations beyond the minimum distance to the points in -C.
	     f will pass locations outside the polygons in -F.
	     g will pass locations outside the grid mask in -G.
	     l will pass locations beyond the minimum distance to the lines in -L.
	     r will pass locations outside the region given in -R [and -J].
	     s will pass locations that otherwise would be skipped in -N.
	     z will pass locations outside the range given in -Z (single -Z required).
	-J Select the map proJection. The projection type is identified by a 1- or
	   2-character ID (e.g. 'm' or 'kf') or by an abbreviation followed by a slash
	   (e.g. 'cyl_stere/'). When using a lower-case ID <scale> can be given either as 1:<xxxx>
	   or in cm/degree along the standard parallel. Alternatively, when the projection ID is
	   Capitalized, <scale>|<width> denotes the width of the plot in cm
	   Append +dh for map height, +du for max map dimension, and +dl for min map dimension [Default +dw is width].
	   When the central meridian (lon0) is optional and omitted, the center of the
	   longitude range specified by -R is used. The default standard parallel is the equator

	   Specify this information with s or k using 1 of 2 formats:
	     -N<wet>/<dry>.
	     -N<ocean>/<land>/<lake>/<island>/<pond>.
	   k means keep and s means skip [Default is s/k/s/k/s (i.e., s/k)].
	-R Specify the min/max coordinates of your data region in user units.
	   Use dd:mm[:ss] for regions given in arc degrees, minutes [and seconds].
	   Use -R<xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax>+<unit> for regions given in projected coordinates.
	     with <unit> selected from e|f|k|M|n|u.
	   Use [yyy[-mm[-dd]]]T[hh[:mm[:ss[.xxx]]]] format for time axes.
	   Append +r if -R specifies the coordinates of the lower left and
	     upper right corners of a rectangular area.
	   Use -R<gridfile> to use its limits (and increments if applicable).
	   Use -Rg and -Rd as shorthands for -R0/360/-90/90 and -R-180/180/-90/90.
	   Derive region from closed polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW):
	     Append a comma-separated list of ISO 3166 codes for countries to set region, i.e.,
	     <code1>,<code2>,... etc., using the 2-character ISO country codes (see pscoast -E+l for list).
	     To select a state of a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
	     To select a whole continent, give =AF|AN|AS|EU|OC|NA|SA as <code>.
	     Use +r to modify the region from polygon(s): Append <inc>, <xinc>/<yinc>, or <winc>/<einc>/<sinc>/<ninc>
	     to round region to these multiples; use +R to extend region by those increments instead [0].
	   Or use -R<code><x0>/<y0>/<n_columns>/<n_rows> for origin and grid dimensions, where
	     <code> is a 2-char combo from [T|M|B][L|C|R] (top/middle/bottom/left/center/right)
	     and grid spacing must be specified via -I<dx>[/<dy>] (also see -r).
	-V Change the verbosity level (currently v).
	   Choose among 6 levels; each level adds more messages:
	     q - Quiet, not even fatal error messages.
	     n - Normal verbosity: only error messages.
	     c - Also produce compatibility warnings [Default when no -V is used].
	     v - Verbose progress messages [Default when -V is used].
	     l - Long verbose progress messages.
	     d - Debugging messages.
	-Z Assume the 3rd data column contains z-values and we want to keep records with
	   <min> <= z <= <max>.  Use - for <min> or <max> if there is no lower/upper limit.
	   Append +c<col> to select another column than the third [2].
	   If <max> is not given we pass records whose z equal <min> within 5 ulps.
	   The -Z option is repeatable.  If given more than once then these modifiers may be useful:
	     +a: Pass the record if any of the tests are true [all tests must be true in order to pass].
	     +i: Reverse an individual test since -Iz only applies to a single test.
	     If +c is not given then it is incremented automatically, starting at 2.
	-a Give one or more comma-separated <col>=<name> associations
	   [Default selects all aspatial fields].
	-bi For binary input; [<n>]<type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D.
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	   Default is 2 input columns (3 if -Z is used).
	-bo For binary output; append <type>[w][+l|b]; <type> = c|u|h|H|i|I|l|L|f|D..
	    Prepend <n> for the number of columns for each <type>.
	-d On input, replace <nodata> with NaN; on output do the reverse.
	-e Only accept input data records that contain the string "pattern".
	   Use -e~"pattern" to only accept data records that DO NOT contain this pattern.
	   If your pattern begins with ~, escape it with \~.  To match against
	   extended regular expressions use -e[~]/regexp/[i] (i for case-insensitive).
	   Give +f<file> for a file list with such patterns, one per line.
	   To give a single pattern starting with +f, escape it with \+f.
	-f Special formatting of input/output columns (time or geographical).
	   Specify i(nput) or o(utput) [Default is both input and output].
	   Give one or more columns (or column ranges) separated by commas.
	   Append T (Calendar format), t (time relative to TIME_EPOCH),
	   f (floating point), x (longitude), y (latitude) to each item.
	   -f[i|o]g means -f[i|o]0x,1y (geographic coordinates).
	   -f[i|o]c means -f[i|o]0-1f (Cartesian coordinates).
	   -fp[<unit>] means input x,y are in projected coordinates.
	-g Use data point separations to determine if there are data gaps.
	   Append x|X or y|Y to identify data gaps in x or y coordinates,
	   respectively, and append d|D for distance gaps.  Upper case X|Y|D means
	   we first project the points (requires -J).  Append <gap>[unit][+n|p]; +n uses
	   d=prev-curr, +p uses d=curr-prev [d=|curr-prev|]; d must exceed <gap> to detect a gap.
	   For geographic data: choose from e|f|k|M|n|u [Default is meter (e)].
	   For gaps based on mapped coordinates: choose unit from c|i|p [cm].
	   For time data: the unit is controlled by TIME_UNIT.
	   For generic data: the unit is as the data implies (user units).
	   Repeat the -g option to specify multiple criteria, and add -ga
	   to indicate that all criteria must be met [just one must be met].
	-h[i][<n>][+c][+d][+r<remark>][+t<title>] Input/output file has [0] Header record(s) [OFF]
	   Optionally, append i for input only and/or number of header records [0].
	     -hi turns off the writing of all headers on output.
	   Append +c to add header record with column information [none].
	   Append +d to delete headers before adding new ones [Default will append headers].
	   Append +r to add a <remark> comment to the output [none].
	   Append +t to add a <title> comment to the output [none].
	     (these strings may contain \n to indicate line-breaks)
	   For binary files, <n> is considered to mean number of bytes.
	-i Sets alternate input column order and optional transformations [Default reads all columns in original order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> to pick a word from the text.
	   Use -in for considering numerical input only.
	   Does not apply to files given via -C, -F, or -L.
	-o Set alternate output column order [Default writes all columns in order].
	   Append list of columns; t[<word>] = trailing text; use <word> for writing a single word from the text.
	   Use -on for numerical output only.
	-s Suppress output for records whose z-value (col = 2) equals NaN
	   [Default prints all records].
	   Append <cols> to examine other column(s) instead [2].
	   Append +a to suppress records where any column equals NaN, or
	   append +r to reverse the suppression (only output z = NaN records).
	-: Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output [OFF/OFF].
	-^ (or -) Print short synopsis message.
	-+ (or +) Print longer synopsis message.
	-? (or no arguments) Print this usage message.
	--PAR=<value> Temporarily override GMT default setting(s) (repeatable).
	(See gmt.conf man page for GMT default parameters).
